# DartTest
dart assessment from invisible technologies

You are tasked with building a simple command-line-based To-Do List Manager using Dart. The application should allow users to perform the following operations:



1. Add a task: Users can add a new task to the to-do list.

2. Remove a task: Users can remove a task from the list by specifying the task number.

3. View all tasks: Users can view all the tasks currently in the list.

4. Mark a task as completed: Users can mark a task as completed.

5. Exit the application: Users can exit the application.



Each task should have a status of either "Pending" or "Completed" and a description.

Your program should continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.

You should use a Dart list to store the tasks.
